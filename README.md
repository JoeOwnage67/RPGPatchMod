**Description**

This mod patches **Mr. Samuel Streamer's RPG Adventure Flavour Pack** (1.5 version available here: https://github.com/MrSamuelStreamer/RPGFantasyFlavourMod) to incorporate changes for my modpack:

Joe's 1.5 Playtested Medieval Fantasy Modlist and Configs  
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3319070383

Changes are applied to 1.5 branch only.  

**My changes:**  

**Removed:**    
-**Medieval Overhaul** defs: DankPyon_Book_AncientCodex, DankPyon_Book_IntoTheRuins, DankPyon_Book_TheBeginning. (causing errors)  
-**Medieval Medicines MO Edition** eye patch if **[CZK] Eye Prosthetics (Continued)** is loaded.  

**Added:**  
-Compatibility for **Grimoires** mod to spawn grimoires in lootable bookshelves in Medieval Overhaul hideouts and ruins.  
-Compatibility for **[CZK] Eye Prosthetics (Continued)**:  
  	-changed research to align with Medieval Overhaul.  
	-made tribal eyepatch recipe use any leather instead of just light leather.  
	-made regular eyepatch recipe use cloth or **Medieval Overhaul**'s linen.  
	-made glass eye use glass from **Rebuild: Doors and Corners** if mod is loaded.  
        
-Compatibility for **Medieval Medicines: Medieval Overhaul Edition** added to cryptosleep casket patch.  

-Added Tordune subspecies to Loxodon xenotype if **FRBE Loxo** is loaded. Adds a new head type and a new gene.  

-Traveling Apothecary Artificer caravan added to MO Noble Houses that sells small quantities of:  
   	-Medieval Med: MO Edition prosthetics and medicine  
 	-Medieval Overhaul Drugs  
 	-Neutroamine  
  	-Heartstone from **Asimov** for building Warforged from **Forgotten Realms**.  
 	-more  
  
-Library trader caravan now sells all **Medieval Overhaul** books, but will not always have them all available. (except for intermediate cooking, I couldn't add that one for some reason)  

-Added no-facial-animations gene to certain modded xenotypes where they look better without it. I will add more as I notice them in my game.  

-Added ability to mine raw mithril (plasteel) at **Medieval Overhaul** mine.  
  
-Added ability to mine raw oricalcum (uranium) at **Medieval Overhaul** mine and refine it into ingots at the furnace.  

**Replaced:**  
-Oken's **Medieval Quest Rewards** with Botch Job's (uses patched base game defs).  

**Changed:**  
	-Nerfed the amount of tanning liquor the Medieval Overhaul tanning rack uses.  
	-Broombug spawns _less often_ in biomes.  
 	-Changed research for **Stargates!** (arcane portals) to Medieval tech level.  
  	-Made Loxodon pawnkinds not wear headgear (doesn't fit).  
  	-Made Loxodon xenotype not spawn in premade factions (for now, will re-add with pawnkinds so they don't spawn with headgear).  
	-Made it possible to use WizardTales xenotypes, but you'd need to add a number of additional gene mods, which are not in my modpack, to get them to work as intended:  
   
1. Turnovus' "Integrated Genes"  
2. GwenBlanketSpecter's "Meditation Traits and Genes"  
3. Danzen's "Vanilla Psycast Expanded - Biotech Integration"  
4. LTS's "Glowing eyes genes"  
5. 6262soudai's "VPE-Biotech Integration for Alpha Animals and More!"

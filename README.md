**Joe's Custom Patches for RPG Adventure Flavour Pack**

I tried to make a custom fork of **Mr. Samuel Streamer's RPG Adventure Flavour Pack** but I couldn't get it working, so instead I made this patch mod.  

Changes have been made to 1.5 branch only.  

**My changes:**  

**Removed:**    
-**Medieval Overhaul** defs: DankPyon_Book_AncientCodex, DankPyon_Book_IntoTheRuins, DankPyon_Book_TheBeginning. (causing errors)  
-**Medieval Medicines MO Edition** eye patch if **[CZK] Eye Prosthetics (Continued)** is loaded.  

**Added:**  
-Compatibility for **[CZK] Eye Prosthetics (Continued)**:  
  	-changed research to align with Medieval Overhaul.  
	-made tribal eyepatch recipe use any leather instead of just light leather.  
	-made regular eyepatch recipe use cloth or Medieval Overhaul's linen.  
	-made glass eye use glass from Rebuild: Doors and Corners if mod is loaded.  
        
-Compatibility for **Medieval Medicines: Medieval Overhaul Edition** added to cryptosleep casket patch.  

-Added Tordune subspecies to Loxodon xenotype if **FRBE Loxo** is loaded. Adds a new head type and a new gene.  

-Traveling Apothecary Artificer caravan added to MO Noble Houses that sells small quantities of:  
   	-Medieval Med: MO Edition prosthetics and medicine  
 	-Medieval Overhaul Drugs  
 	-Neutroamine  
 	-Occasional natural body part  
 	-more  

-Library trader caravan now sells all **Medieval Overhaul** books, but will not always have them all available. (except for intermediate cooking, I couldn't add that one for some reason)  

-Added no-facial-animations gene to certain xenotypes where they look better without it. I will add more as I notice them in my game.  

**Replaced:**  
-Oken's **Medieval Quest Rewards** with Botch Job's (uses patched base game defs).  

**Changed:**  
	-Nerfed the amount of tanning liquor the Medieval Overhaul tanning rack uses.  
	-Broombug spawns _less often_ in biomes.  
	-Made it possible to use WizardTales xenotypes, but you'd need to add a number of additional gene mods, which are not in my modpack, to get them to work as intended:  
 		-Turnovus' _Integrated Genes_  
   		-GwenBlanketSpecter's _Meditation Traits and Genes_  
	 	-Danzen's _Vanilla Psycast Expanded - Biotech Integration_  
   		-LTS's _Glowing eyes genes_  
	 	-6262soudai's _VPE-Biotech Integration for Alpha Animals and More!_
